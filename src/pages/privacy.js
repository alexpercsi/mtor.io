          <strong>In Short:</strong>  We keep your information for as long as
          necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
          policy unless otherwise required by law. We will only keep your

          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
          personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if
          this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
          has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
          personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
          deletion is possible.

          from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
          deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete

        <p>
          <strong>In Short: </strong> In some regions, such as the European
          Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and
          control over your personal information. You may review, change, or
          terminate your account at any time. <br></br>In some regions (like the
          European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data
          protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and
          obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
          rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your
          personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
          certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
          processing of your personal information. To make such a request,
          please use the <a href="mailto:support@mtor.io">contact details</a>
           provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in
          accordance with applicable data protection laws. If we are relying on
          your consent to process your personal information, you have the right
          to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this
          will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
          withdrawal.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
          are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
          right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

        <h3 id="data-breach">7. DATA BREACH</h3>
        <p>
          A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or
          collection, use, disclosure or disposal of personal information. You
          will be notified about data breaches when Mtor.io believes you are
          likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a data breach may
          be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental
          or physical well-being. In the event that Mtor.io becomes aware of a
          security breach which has resulted or may result in unauthorized
          access, use or disclosure of personal information Mtor.io will
          promptly investigate the matter and notify the applicable Supervisory
          Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it,
          unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the
          rights and freedoms of natural persons.

        <h3 id="controls">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
          activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
          online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
          technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
          been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
          signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
          choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
          adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about
          that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
