             Mtor.io is a project by:<br />

            <p>This is a non-profit, non-commercial project. There is no legal obligation for
            neither the mentor nor &quot;Mtor.io&quot; and its founders that can be inferred by any communication or interaction that occurs between
             mentors and members of the group (referred to as ‘mentees’). The
            communication is suggestion only and there is no accountability by
            “Mtor.io” or its members after the sessions conclude.</p>
